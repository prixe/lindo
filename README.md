## Installation 
### Prerequisites
#### Node.js
- Windows : [Website](https://nodejs.org)
- Linux
```sh
$ apt-get install nodejs
```
- macOS
```sh
$ brew install nodejs
```
### Build Lindo
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/prixe/lindo.git
$ cd lindo
$ npm install
```

## Start project in dev mode
Compile electron typescript source and angular source in developpement mode with a watcher :
```sh
$ npm run build:dev
```
Start the project in electron :
```sh
$ npm start
```
## Distribution building
If you want to make a release for a specific system, make sure build the project in production mode first:
```sh
$ npm run build:prod
```
Then you can use this command :

### Windows
On a windows environment :
```sh
$ npm run release:win
```
On a unix system (require docker)
```sh
$ docker-compose up
```
### Linux
```sh
$ npm run release:linux
```
### macOS
Only available on macOS system :
```sh
$ npm run release:mac
```

## Development
### Introduction
**Lindo** is developed with [Angular](https://angular.io/) as web framework and uses [Material](https://material.angular.io/) for the UI. It uses [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) to be run as an standalone application, wich is based on Node.js and Chromium.

So we have to distinguish 2 contexts :
- **Navigator context** -> executed by Chromium (the Angular part) 
- **Electron context** -> executed by Node.js (it's allow platform interaction)

Navigator context is in the ```src/```folder and Electron context is in the ```electron/``` folder.


The idea is to simulate the environment Dofus Touch to run it on PC, because Dofus Touch is based on [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/).

### Commands explanation
```sh
$ npm install
```
Installs the packages in package.json and their dependencies

```sh
$ npm run build:dev
```
Executes multiple subcommands to build for development

```sh
$ npm start
```
Executes `electron ./` and since `"main": "/dist/electron/main.js"` (in package.json) it becomes executing `electron ./dist/electron/main.js` which in turn eventually loads `/dist/app/index.html` (which is the angular context) once it gets to `main-window.js`

```sh
$ npm run build:prod
```
Executes multiple subcommands to build for production

```sh
$ npm run release:win
```
(or release:mac or release:linux): executes in the case of release:win for example `build --win --x64 --ia32` to compile and build the final binaries using electron-builder that in turn is using `loaded configuration file=package.json ("build" field)`, and `writing effective config file=releases\builder-effective-config.yaml` resulting in usable files in releases folder

#### Subcommands
- `$ npm run build:dev`
  - `$ npm run build:electron:dev`
    - `$ tsc -p electron/`: transpiles electron context files from TS to JS and puts them in `dist/electron`
    - `$ ncp electron/i18n dist/electron/i18n`: copies i18n files from `electron/i18n` to `dist/electron/i18n`
  - `$ npm run lint`: executes `ng lint` to start lint verification of the files
  - `$ ng build --watch`: builds angular context into dist/app, watches the source files for changes then builds them without the need to re-run this command

- `$ npm run build:prod`
  - `$ npm run build:electron:prod`
    - `$ tsc -p electron/tsconfig.prod.json`: transpiles electron context files from TS to JS and puts them in `dist/electron`
    - `$ ncp electron/i18n dist/electron/i18n`: copies i18n files from `electron/i18n` to `dist/electron/i18n`
  - `$ npm run lint`: executes `$ ng lint` to start lint verification of the files
  - `$ ng build --configuration=production`: builds angular context into dist/app

The config used by angular in `$ ng build (--configuration=production)` is at angular.json and particularly projects => lindo => architect => build => configurations => production. There is also stuff like file replacements inside.

**In the case of errors during building use an older version of node temporarily until the project gets updated and uses a more recent version. I personally use nvm to use the version 8.17.0 of Nodejs when building Lindo.**


### How to help ?
You can contact a senior developer of the project as [Clover](https://github.com/Clover-Lindo) or [Prixe](https://github.com/prixe). Or you can eventually join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wcCgtsv).
Then you can create a pull request to add or fix features, you can also submit improvement idea or bug issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/prixe/lindo/issues).

### Generate the TOC 
If you edit the README.MD you wanna update the table of contents you can easily achieve it by using this command :
```sh
$ npm run toc
```
